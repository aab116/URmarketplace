## 1. Introduction

At the end of each academic term, students living in campus housing frequently leave behind personal items such as furniture, textbooks, kitchenware, and small appliances. These items are often still usable and valuable; however, due to the lack of a centralized and structured system, many of these items are discarded or handled through informal channels. This results in unnecessary waste, loss of potential financial value for students, and inefficiencies within the campus community.

Existing solutions, such as social media groups or informal peer-to-peer exchanges, do not provide sufficient structure, transparency, or administrative oversight. These platforms lack mechanisms to track item ownership, manage pricing consistently, handle holding or storage fees, or ensure secure transactions between buyers and sellers. As a result, both buyers and sellers face uncertainty and increased risk.

This project proposes the design of **URMarketplace**, a conceptual software tool intended to address these challenges by providing a controlled and organized marketplace environment for students. The primary goal of this project is to define the problem clearly and lay the groundwork for a software solution that can be systematically tested and validated using established software testing techniques.

## 2. Design Problem

### 2.1 Problem Definition

Students residing in campus housing at the University of Regina often leave behind personal belongings when moving out, including furniture, books, and household items. Although these items may still be in good condition, there is currently no centralized and reliable system that enables students to resell or transfer ownership of these items in a structured and accountable manner. As a result, items are frequently discarded, misplaced, or sold through informal channels that lack transparency and traceability.

Informal marketplaces do not support essential features such as tracking the original owner of an item, managing item pricing in a consistent manner, applying holding or storage fees, or calculating earnings returned to the seller after a purchase. Furthermore, these platforms lack administrative oversight to manage listings, enforce marketplace rules, and control the lifecycle of items once they are listed. This creates challenges for sellers attempting to recover value from their items and for buyers seeking trustworthy and legitimate transactions.

To address this gap, there is a need for a dedicated software tool, referred to as **URMarketplace**, that provides a structured marketplace tailored to student needs. The system must support the buying and selling of items, track original ownership, manage pricing and holding fees, and record seller earnings when items are purchased. Additionally, the system must allow administrators to oversee item listings, manage transactions, and ensure the proper handling of items throughout their lifecycle.
