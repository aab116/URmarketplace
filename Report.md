<h2 align="left" id="1-introduction">1 — Introduction</h2>


At the end of each academic term, students residing on the university's campus frequently leave behind personal items such as furniture, textbooks, kitchenware, and small appliances. These items are often still in good condition, usable and valuable to many; however, due to the lack of an easy-to-use and centralized system, many of these items are discarded or handled through informal channels. Not only does this void often result in unnecessary waste to students and the environment, but often a fiscal loss to the student leaving and the student in need. This issue will be alleviated by our software, **URMarketplace**. 

Existing solutions, such as social media groups or by word of mouth are currently the trend in which these student adhere to; therefore, through such circumstances it isn't surprising that these are the results. Our design is oriented to lay the groundwork to help out these students at the University of Regina.

### 2.1 — Problem Definition<a id="21-problem-definition"></a>

Informal marketplaces do not support essential features such as tracking the original owner of an item, applying holding or storage fees, or calculating earnings returned to the seller after a purchase. Furthermore, these platforms lack administrative oversight to manage listings such as these for students. UR Marketplace will enforce marketplace rules, and control the lifecycle of items once they are listed. This creates challenges for sellers attempting to recover value from their items and for buyers seeking trustworthy and legitimate transactions.

**URMarketplace** is ideal for addressing this gap, a dedicated software tool for the University of Regina's students living on campus. It will provide the necessary structure tailored to students' needs. The system must support, and not be limited to these key attributes focused on structure, transparency, and easy-to-use software that holds the administrative position to carry the weight so that the students can keep focusing on their academic studies during final and busiest times of their academic career. Strategically, this platform would fill the voids that other marketplace applications lack because it would be designed for students, by students. A few key characteristics of the user-end of the application would be, but not limited to:
1. Posting items to sell.
2. Ability to counter offer.
3. An option for someone to seek out another person to store their item(s) temperarily until it sells; for a fee.
4. Ability to rate users on both ends.
5. University administration oversight ability for regulation and blacklisting if need be.
6. Proper handling of item life-cycle

Functions such as these will lay the groundwork for a software solution that can be systematically tested and validated using established software testing techniques.
